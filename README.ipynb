    "_\"Soccer, known as football outside of North America, is the 'beautiful game' to its multitude of fans. Soccer is played in every corner of the world and inspires its own frenzy every four years with the convening of the international championship known as the World Cup. There is no competition on earth that mobilizes such passion or that is as inclusive as the qualification for this event. The World Cup is entirely controlled through the international governing body for the sport of soccer, FIFA, the French language acronym for the Federation Internationale de Football Association. A testament to the status of soccer as the world's most popular sport. FIFA is unquestionably the most powerful and all-encompassing world sports body.\"_\n",

Due to the lack of linearity, the linear regression model was less precise in predictions than was hoped for.

Additionally, player salaries was not normally distributed, making predictions more challenging for regression models.
